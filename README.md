# doctest4j
doctest4j is a simple yet powerful way of enhancing your unit tests.
The idea behind this library is to provide valueable testdata and a
good and reliable documentation at the same time - as close as possible
towards the code.

Though the name indicates similarities with pythons doctest, it follows
it's own approach and is more influenced by concordion and cucumber.
